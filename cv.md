## Briefly About Myself
I have a higher technical education. Worked as the head of laboratory of non-destructive testing. Currently I am working as an engineer on the railway.
I decided to change my profession, and because I was always interested in computers, I participated in school and city programming olympiads, I chose Front-End development. Studied microcontrollers  and assembler.
I enjoy understanding code, developing new and interesting things.
